# Contributing to the Project
Everyone is encouraged to participate in the SPDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generator project. Anyone can influence the project by simply being involved in the discussions about new features, the roadmap, architecture, and even problems they are facing.

This is the process we suggest for contributions. This process is designed to reduce the burden on project reviews, impact on other contributors, and to keep the amount of rework from the contributor to a minimum.

2. On your development computer, navigate to the ***spdx-sbom-generator*** folder that was created when you forked the project.
3. create a branch (off of main) for your work. If youâ€™re addressing an issue, we suggest you to include the issue type as the branch name, for example:
    ```

    ```
4. Make changes to the project.
5. Commit your changes to your local repo as mentioned in the [important](#important) section below:

**Important:**
* While commiting changes, contrinutors must include a "Signed-off-by" line in the commit message, with the contributors' name and email address, for example:
    ```
    Sign-off-by: Humpty Dumpty <humpty.dumpty@example.com>
    ```
* If you have configured your username and email address in the terminal, juist type ```git commit -s```.

    The ```-s``` option automatically adds your ```Signed-off-by:``` to your commit message. Your commit will be rejected without this line.
    
    Adding ```Sign-off-by``` while commiting changes indicates your agreement with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)]((https://developercertificate.org/)), a copy of which is included below.
